# 01: Linux-Management-With-Docker

Welcome to my Linux Management with Docker project! This project serves as an exploratory way for me to deepen my understanding of the Linux operating system using Docker on my machine.

## Overview

In this project, I demonstrate how to create, manage, and manipulate Linux folders through a Docker container. It covers basic concepts and commands that are essential for managing files and directories within a Linux environment using Docker.

## Features

- **Create Folders:** Learn how to create folders within a Docker container running a Linux OS.
- **Manipulate Files:** Understand the various commands to manipulate files and directories.
- **Manage Permissions:** Explore how to handle user and group permissions.
- **Basic Linux Commands:** Get acquainted with fundamental Linux commands and concepts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine.

## Contact

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Happy learning!
