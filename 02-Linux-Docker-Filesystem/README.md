# Linux Docker Filesystem

## Description

This project aims to study the directory structure in Linux, the file systems used in Linux and Docker containers, and how to work with partitions and volumes. Additionally, it covers sharing files between the local machine (host) and the Docker container running Linux.

Are you starting now? Check out this first: [1-Linux-Management-With-Docker](https://github.com/Caio-Felice-Cunha/Linux-Operating-System-Docker-and-Kubernetes/tree/main/01-Linux-Management-With-Docker).

## Objectives

- Understand the directory structure in Linux
- Explore the file systems used in Linux and Docker
- Learn how to work with partitions and volumes in Linux
- Implement file sharing between the host and Docker container

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Caio-Felice-Cunha/linux-docker-filesystem.git
    cd linux-docker-filesystem
    ```

4. Refer to the documentation in the `Script & Explanations` folder for detailed guides on the file system, partitioning, and volume management.
