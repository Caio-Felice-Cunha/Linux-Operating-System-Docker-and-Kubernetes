# 08 - Container Orchestration with Kubernetes

This repository contains a hands-on lab for container orchestration using Kubernetes. Kubernetes is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. In this lab, you'll learn how to deploy a simple application with two services on a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.

## Features of Kubernetes:
- **Continuous Deployment and Updates**: Simplifies the deployment of containerized applications and automates updates.
- **Load Balancing and Service Discovery**: Efficiently distributes traffic between containers and enables automatic service discovery.
- **Automatic Scaling**: Adjusts the number of containers based on application demand.
- **Storage Management**: Supports various storage solutions for persistent and high-performance storage.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Kubectl**: [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- **Minikube**: [Install Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

## Conclusion

This guides you through the basics of deploying an application on a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. The steps demonstrated here can be extended to deploy more complex applications, making it a valuable exercise for developers and DevOps professionals.
