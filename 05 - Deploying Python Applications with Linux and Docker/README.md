# Lesson 5: Deploying a Python Application with Linux and Docker

In this lesson, we will learn how to deploy a Python application using Linux and Docker. This involves several steps that ensure our application is packaged, tested, and ready for deployment in a containerized environment.

1. Preparing the Work Environment
In this section, we'll set up the necessary tools and dependencies for our Python application and Docker.

2. Building and Testing the App Locally
Before containerizing the application, it's essential to ensure that it works correctly in the local environment.

3. Creating a Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a script that contains the instructions to assemble a Docker image.

4. Creating an Image and Container for Deployment
Once the Dockerfile is ready, we can build an image and run a container.

5. Testing the Application and Troubleshooting
After deploying the application in a container, itâ€™s important to test it thoroughly and troubleshoot any issues.
